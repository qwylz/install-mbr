Changes since 1.1.7:

* The "boot floppy" option in the TestDisk image has been fixed.  It
  previously failed to work in any circumstances.

Changes since 1.1.6:

* There is an extra variant of the code for the disk recovery
  program called TestDisk.

Changes since 1.1.5:

* A bug which was introduced when big disk support was added, has been
  fixed.  Systems which use the big disk interface can now boot old
  versions of syslinux.

Changes since 1.1.4:

* The -y option is now persistent.  It is read from the MBR and the
  newly installed sector has the same setting.

Changes since 1.1.3:

* The configured delay can now be as long as an hour, rather than 14
  seconds.

Changes since 1.1.2:

* Added the Y2k bug fix from Santiago Garcia Mantinan
  <manty@debian.org>.  This is enabled using the -y option.

Changes since 1.1.1:

* The MBR now prints out the string "MBR" to show it's presence.

Changes since 1.1.0:

* A couple of major bugs have been fixed, which would cause the system
  to fail to boot.

* The installation program now has a man page.

Changes since 1.0.1:

* There is now an installation program (install-mbr).

* Support for accessing large disks (>8G) has been added.  This means
  that the active partition doesn't have to be within the first 8G for
  the MBR to load it's boot sector.  The new code will be used on
  systems which support it.

* The build environment is now created by automake.

* There is now a (small) test suite.
