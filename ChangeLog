	* Fixed a NULL pointer dereference in VM event handling.

	* No longer distribute wraptest since it is generated.  We
	  now run the correct copy of wraptest.

	* Added a leading zero to octal numbers in escape codes passed to
	  echo for more consistent behaviour.

	* Released version 1.1.11.

Sat Jul 19 17:06:08 2008  Neil Turton  <neilt+mbr@chiark.greenend.org.uk>

	* Switched to automake-1.9.  This removes a warning about
	  --datarootdir being ignored.

	* Explicitly set the version of autoconf to be used to avoid
	  potential incompatibilities with other versions.

Sun May  6 21:53:30 2007  Neil Turton  <neilt+mbr@chiark.greenend.org.uk>

	* Updated Daniel B. Sedory's address.

	* Removed uses of type-punning which make newer versions
	  of GCC choke.

	* Coded vm86 syscall in an asm rather than using _syscall2 since
	  some kernels protect _syscall2 with __KERNEL__.

	* Released version 1.1.10

Sat Sep  2 17:33:56 2006  Neil Turton  <neilt+mbr@chiark.greenend.org.uk>

	* Disabled the execution tests for x86_64.

	* Added maintainer mode (disabled by default) so that users can't
	  need the correct versions of automake and autoconf installed.

	* Fixed some typos in the manual page and added a section on the
	  boot-time behaviour of the MBR.

	* Fixed some warnings.

	* Stopped using the _binary_mbr_b_size symbol since it is absolute
	  and they don't work with -fPIE.

	* Released version 1.1.9

Sun Mar 20 18:23:38 2005  Neil Turton  <neilt+mbr@chiark.greenend.org.uk>

	* Fixed the "boot floppy" option in the TestDisk image.  Due to a
	bug, it previously attempted to boot track 334 of the floppy,
	which never succeeded.

	* Released version 1.1.8

Sat Mar 12 15:09:14 2005  Neil Turton  <neilt+mbr@chiark.greenend.org.uk>

	* Added TestDisk variant.  This has a banner rather than a menu
	prefix and has a particular set of config options.  The main
	variants are unchanged.
	
	* Released version 1.1.7

Sun Jan 16 19:14:28 2005  Neil Turton  <neilt+mbr@chiark.greenend.org.uk>

	* Save and restore si around the disk read, since it gets loaded
	  with the address of the disk address packet.

	* Updated the testsuite to dump out the partition entry.
	
	* Released version 1.1.6

Sat Sep 15 12:39:03 2001  Neil Turton  <neilt@chiark.greenend.org.uk>

	* Released version 1.1.5

Fri Sep 14 23:23:34 2001  Neil Turton  <neilt@chiark.greenend.org.uk>

	* Finally updated the test suite to use the new test harness
	prompted by yet another DOSemu change which broke the old test
	suite.  DOSemu is no longer required to run the tests.

	* Made --y2k option persistent like other options.  Added
	--y2k=off to revert to default state.  Made "--y2k --list" install
	new code like the manual page says.  Added tests for these bugs.

	* Added new tests for compatibility of the installer with old
	versions of the code.

Sat Jul 14 13:55:38 2001  Neil Turton  <neilt@chiark.greenend.org.uk>

	* Created a VM86 test harness to replace DOSemu, and avoid the
	changes to configuration file and improved `security' measures.
	This also removes an external dependency.

Mon Jul 23 10:40:32 2001  Neil Turton  <neilt@chiark.greenend.org.uk>

	* Released version 1.1.4

	* Made incompatible change by increasing the size of the delay
	field.

	* Introduced a new parameter layout support in install-mbr.  Added
	a compile-time flag to switch to the new layout in mbr.S86
	(currently disabled).

	* Made the version routines pickier.  Doing anything with an
	incompatible version is now banned.  Updated the manual page to
	match.

Fri Apr  6 19:41:32 2001  Neil Turton  <neilt@chiark.greenend.org.uk>

	* Released version 1.1.3

	* Changed version number scheme to maintain a set of assembly
	flags.

	* Upgraded dosemu.conf to deal with recent versions of DOSemu.
	Also added a wrapper to give DOSemu a tty on stdin.

	* Added Y2K BIOS bug fix from Santiago Garcia Mantinan
	<manty@debian.org>

 	on entry).
  	
	* The drive number passed by the BIOS is used if the configured
	drive is 0xFF.
