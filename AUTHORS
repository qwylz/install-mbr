Thanks to:

  Santiago Vila <sanvila@unex.es> for maintaining the Debian package.

  Kalle Olavi Niemitalo <tosi@ees2.oulu.fi> for submitting a number of
    bug fixes.

  Tom Rothamel <tom-10990@onegeek.org> for writing the initial logo
    code.

  Santiago Garcia Mantinan <manty@debian.org> for initiating the
    y2kbug alternative mbr to work round a Y2K bug in 1994/1995 Award
    BIOSes, having taken over the Debian package from the other
    Santiago.  Thanks also for providing the basis for extending the
    maximum time limit.

  Massimo Dal Zotto <dz@cs.unitn.it> for drawing my attention to the
    fact that the big disk interface support code broke early versions
    of syslinux.  Big blush on my part.  ;)

    the introduction into TestDisk, a partition recovery program.
